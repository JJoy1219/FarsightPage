        <h2>About Farsight</h2>
        <p>Farsight is a League of Legends companion app that provides near real time advice to players about
            macro level decisions based on an advanced machine learning model trained on thousands of games.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>"Should I push for a plate or back and buy" is a complicated question. Farsight will show players
            a few potential decisions and their effect on predicted win rate.

        <h2>Where We Are</h2>
        <p>
            Initial backend development is complete. The next step is to scale up the number of
            games to be processed, as we will need access to tens of thousands of games to
            deliver the most precise suggestions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            We will also be using Overwolf technology to develop an in-game overlay as seen in the mockups.
