        <h2>About Farsight</h2>
        <p>Farsight is a League of Legends companion app that provides near real time advice to players about
            macro level decisions based on an advanced machine learning model trained on thousands of games.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>"Should I push for a plate or back and buy" is a complicated question. Farsight will show players
            a few potential decisions and their effect on predicted win rate.

        <h2>Where We Are</h2>
        <p>
            Initial backend development is complete. The next step is to scale up the number of
            games to be processed, as we will need access to tens of thousands of games to
            deliver the most precise suggestions.
            <br><br>
            We will also be using Overwolf technology to develop an in-game overlay as seen in the mockups.

        <h2>Technical Overview</h2>
        <h3>Data Pipeline</h3>
        <p>
            Data is queried via python scripts from the Riot API and written more or less as is in JSON format on a local machine. Match data and match timelines are the primary data of importance, but summoner data, match history, and league rankings are used to properly sort and acquire data.
            <br><br>This data is then pre-processed into a series of 60 second intervals via Python scripts. A match + its timeline has the information needed to reconstruct most of the information in the match, but it is a non-trivial task to determine what items Lux had at 1333 seconds into a match. This data is stored locally for later use by machine learning models.
            <br><br>Data is segregated by rank, as information from Challenger games is not going to be useful in predicting the outcome of Iron rank games, and both players need different advice.
        </p>
        <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>
            This process is still being built out. An initial attempt at using the Keras framework neural network based time series model with a small sample of 3000 matches did not converge, likely due to the number of columns in the dataset compared to the sample size.
            <br><br>Once the sample is increased to tens of thousands, we are planning to first re-try the same approach, but may also work with different frameworks to see which has the best performance ratio.
            <br><br>It is certain that models will be quantized to be as efficient as possible, as the nature of doing near real time inference during gameplay is that GPU time will be limited. Tentatively the model will be quantized and then deployed using Tensorflow.js, but this is subject to change after experimentation.
            <br><br>Further model details will be included as research proceeds.
        </p>
        <h3>Overwolf + Live Game API</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://overwolf.github.io/">Overwolf</a> is a pre-existing game overlay vendor that will greatly simplify UI design, as it already has the capacity to provide in-game overlay for League of Legends. Converting the ML model to a Tensorflow.js should (key word should) allow it to work within Overwolf.
            <br><br>The model will be fed information from Riot’s live game API (such as player CS), and will then determine the most relevant (not necessarily the best) possible macro decisions and display them with color coding. E.g. “Do dragon 54% win rate” (and color coded) or “Continue farming 47% win rate.”

            <br><br>To determine relevance, it will look at player lane / overall map status like elite monster cooldowns. So, unlike the mockup images, it will not show “rotate for dragon” if dragon was just killed. Similarly, while mid might see a “gank bottom” suggestion, top will not, as that is very rare in normal games. It will, however, show options with a variety of estimated outcomes to allow for player choice.
            
            <br><br>The purpose of this is to highlight decisions that are important and give multiple choices to help players make good decisions, as required by Riot API standards. The mod supplements but does not replace player analysis and intuition.
            
            <br><br>Additionally, when the player is in the store, it will also provide itemization hints using similar historical analysis. 
            <br><br>Moreover, based on historical trends, players during laning phase will receive a gank risk indicated by an icon, number, and optional sound cues. Should they be pushed into enemy tower without vision at 3:40? Probably not! But this is something newer players could appreciate additional feedback on.
            <br><br><b>Note</b>: the model <b>never</b> tells the player what to do, and it doesn’t have access to health/mana data, so this is a helpful guideline to several choices the player can make that still requires their own decision making and analysis.
